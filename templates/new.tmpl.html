        <h1>IBM Years</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Participated in the BE4WS (Business Explorer for Web Services) project.
                BE4WS is a web-based tool to query UDDI
                (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) repositories.
                It can aggregate query results returned from multiple UDDI repositories
                and eliminate redundant information.
                Our research result has been published in IBM Alphaworks
                (http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/be4ws) and
                has been incorporated into WSTK (Web Services Toolkit) 3.1,
                IBM’s popular and free development toolkit for web services.</li>
            <li>Worked on the issue of tooling and configuration for BPSM
                (Business Process Solution Management).
                Our research on BPSM project will be aligned with IBM’s
                strategy on BAM (Business Activity Monitoring).
                BPSM is a project involving different IBM departments.</li>
            <li>Designed BPCL (Business Process Commitment Language) for BPSM.
                BPCL allows business analysts to conveniently define external commitments
                (among trading partners) and internal commitments
                (among internal departments) in an XML Schema-based language.
                BPCL is a part of the BPSM project.</li>
