<h1>RESEARCH STATEMENT</h1>

<h2>Max Haifei Li</h2>

<p>Research activities are an important part of my job as a professor. For many
years, I have conducted research independently and collaborated with other
researchers, professors and students all over the world. My research has
brought positive economic and academic impacts on both the national and the
international levels. I have more than 20 publications and my research results
have been built into commercial products. Currently I am actively involved in
research activities such as academic conference organization, journal and
conference paper reviewing and editing, and independent research.
My research interests are e-learning, database, e-commerce, automated business
negotiation and business process management.</p>


<p> I have been working with Professor Qinghua Zheng, a professor at Xi'an
Jiaotong University for many years. I have visited Xi'an Jiaotong University
twice after I gradated there in 1990. I have collaborated with him to write
papers that have been published in conferences and journals. Recently, I have
worked in an open source project called EAS (Electronic Attendance Sheet) to
automatically sign up students when they are in classroom.</p>

<p> Database is my favorite topic since I was a graduate student at the
University of Forida. My advisor Dr. Stanley Y. W. Su has been the director
for the Database Center at the University of Flordia for many years. Right now,
I am teaching database course at Union University. I am using MySQL as the
database engine. In addition, I added PHP as an element of the database course.
As a result, my course is really <strong>PHP/MySQL for undergraduates</strong>.
<p>

<p>E-commerce (i.e., e-business) is a growth engine of the global economy.  The
dotcom crash does not invalidate the overall success of e-commerce.  Actually
the crash may help the long-term growth of e-commerce by getting rid of
ill-formed technical ideas and unrealistic business plans. In order to ensure
the healthy growth of e-commerce, there are many research issues to be tackled.
My graduate research study at University of Florida and my post-doctoral
research at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center are focused on E-commerce.
Specifically, I have been pursuing research in privacy,
BPM (Business Process Management), business negotiation and application
integration.</p>

<p>Privacy is one of the most important reasons why people avoid e-commerce
despite the huge benefits brought by e-commerce. In the conventional view of
provider-consumer relationship, providers dictate what information consumers
should provide and consumer is powerless. We argue that the consumer should
have a way to negotiate with the provider about the nature of private
information to be revealed. We call it “privacy negotiation”. In addition,
we argue that we need a mechanism to monitor whether the providers actually
comply with the “privacy policy” they have promised. We call it
“privacy monitoring”. The combination of privacy negotiation and privacy
monitoring becomes a powerful framework for information privacy protection.
The initial result of the work has been published in IEEE Conference on
Electronic Commerce (IEEE CEC 2004).</p>

<p>At IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, I have developed an XML Schema-based
language called BPCL (Business Process Commitment Language) to specify business
commitments. Unlike contracts and SLAs, BPCL includes commitments from
multiple parties. Therefore, it is possible to perform global optimization.
I also introduced the concept of KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to
designate the things to be monitored and controlled. At the lower level,
probe points are defined to provide the raw data needed to compute KPIs.
Once KPIs and their associated threshold are available, business commitments
can be defined based on these KPIs and thresholds. The language and
associated components provide a scalable and extensible infrastructure
for business process configuration, monitoring and control. Our research
results have been published in several conference papers. Recently,
we have positioned BPCL as the language for BAM (Business Activity
Monitoring). According to the Gartner Group, the market for BAM will
be one billion dollars in 2004. Many companies, including IBM, are
aggressively pursuing this market.</p>

<p>In my Ph.D. dissertation “Automated E-Business Negotiation: Model, Life Cycle,
and System Architecture,” I have proposed a negotiation model to link
business negotiation policies with business negotiation strategies.
I have also proposed a negotiation life cycle model in the dissertation.
Although the models provide insights into business negotiation,
there are still many open issues for business negotiations.
How to conduct one-to-many negotiation based on many bi-lateral negotiations?
How to coordinate these negotiations? How to simulate business negotiations?
How to make concessions based on my own preference, counterpart’s actions,
and the business environment?</p>

<p>My work for application integration is an extension of my Master’s thesis
“Modeling and Validation of Business Object Documents for Application
System Integration.” My master’s thesis is a rule-based approach to
application integration. In the future, I would like to combine rule-based
approach with agent-based approach to have a comprehensive framework for
application integration.</p>

<p>Services computing is the evolution of Internet computing toward a services
oriented architecture. By services oriented, we mean that businesses will
purchase functionality in chunks. Rather than buying software for permanent
in-house installation, companies will buy services as needed, much like they
pay for an airline ticket as opposed to having a company jet on standby.
My interests in services computing are how to apply services computing model
in the BPM (Business Process Management) environment.</p>

<p>Computer Ethics deals with the impacts of computers, especially the Internet,
on computer professionals and ordinary users. There are many aspects of the
impact: social, legal, philosophical, constitutional, and economic. One
aspect that I am especially interested in is the ethical issues related to
E-commerce. Sometime ago, Amazon.com tested a differentiated pricing model.
Although Amazaon.com later abandoned the test, but the ethical question
remains: it is ethical for an online vendor to give different prices of the
same kinds of items to different users? Sometime ago, a Marine was killed
in Iraq and the Marine’s family wanted to have access to the email account.
However, the family member’s request to Yahoo was rejected because of the
privacy concern. Does Yahoo do a good thing, or it has it gone too far?</p>

<p>Being an assistant professor at a privileged university like Union University,
I am greatly encouraged by the leaders of Union and the excellent quality of
our students to further my research on E-business/E-commerce and other areas.
Meanwhile, my teaching activities have been a great source of inspiration on
my research studies. </p>
